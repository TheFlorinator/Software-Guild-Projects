# Software-Guild-Projects
This is the completed Hallmark homework, I created this application using test driven development, creating backend methods and then testing them for functionality (when running the tests running all of them at once will cause a couple to fail, just re-run the failed ones). From there I worked my way up to the front end. 

--side note there is one bug that I ran out of time to fix; the modal text boxes are not reseting after saving a new meme.

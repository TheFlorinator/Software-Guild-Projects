# Software-Guild-Projects
The Blog to Restart is our final capstone prjoect, and this has been created by two other students and me. It is a food blog written for a mock company, anyone can go to it and view the blogs. I created multiple permissions for accessing and managing the site, an employee with writer access is able to write blogs, an employee with admin access is able to review and publish already written posts as well as edit posts, and the owner is able to login and have all other access as well as changing the roles that are assigned to each employee. I have worked mainly on the backend, creating the logic layer and helping to set up Entity and hook into the database. I also use Identity for authorization, and restricting access to certain parts of the web application, as well as, making a few simple views.
